# NumberConverter_P1
Converts ANY 32 bit value in any representation 
(binary, hexadecimal, unsigned decimal, signed decimal) to any of other representation. 
Also you can convert a certain bit width of the 32 bit word, and/or the range of the bit word.

Please Note! I got 97.5% on this project and this project ran perfectly everytime!
However, after I reinstalled my operating system and conducted disk utilities clean-up,
this project is giving me negative ascii values, so the -b and -r are not working correctly 
with my version even though they are not the negative ascii values given on the ascii table 
(http://www.asciitable.com/ - they would be negative after 127).
Hopefully you do not have this problem
